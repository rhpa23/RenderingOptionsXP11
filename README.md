# Rendering options for XP11

For Windows only. Required .Net Framework 4.5 or above.

This windows application was made for personal and shared use freely for XP community with the objective to facilitate the changes of the datarefs offered in X-Plane 11. I used as a reference the [XP 11 Advanced Settings] (http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/35733-xp-11-advanced-settings/) made by Forkboy2 and some other data which I found relevant in the forums. Others may be added in the future. 


To install

1 Install FlyWithLua Plugin for X-Plane 11. [Download](http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/35579-flywithlua-for-x-plane-11-and-10-windows-linux-mac-os-x-version/)
2 Download "XP11SettingsTool.zip" file and unzip in the folder of your choice.
3 Execute "XP11SettingsTool.exe" and enjoy.


Considerations:
  The "Settings.lua" file must be saved in FlywithLua "Scripts" folder. Like: <C:\X-Plane11\resources\plugins\FlywithLua\Scripts>
  To uninstall simple delete this "Settings.lua" file  that you saved on Scripts folder
  Click in "Default" button and save to return XP11 default values. 
  Click in "Undo" to return the last saved settings.
  Remember to save the settings before exit. 
  IMPORTANT: Not all ranges was tested. If you set a value where XP11 will rejects and you had a FlyWithLua error please report the issue here.
